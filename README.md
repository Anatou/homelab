Scripts for my homelab

This repo serves both as 
- A convenient way to write my script in my IDE instead of the VMs and then pull them from the VMs
- A way to store my scripts

This is not a complete documentation of my homelab. The main documentation is private in my obsidian vault

To download specific files from the command line
```bash
apt update && apt install wget
wget https://github.com/Anatou/homelab/raw/refs/heads/main/path/to/file.yaml
